# zapret-toolkit

Linux Bash toolkit for managing and testing [zapret](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret) DPI bypass strategies.

Linux-only Bash scripts that simplify firewalld rule management, kernel module loading, and automated testing of previously discovered working zapret strategies.
Tested on openSUSE Leap 15.6.
Expected to work on other systemd-based Linux distributions with firewalld (e.g. Tumbleweed, Fedora), but not tested yet.
